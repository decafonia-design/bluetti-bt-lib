"""Find out why a station stops answering, and which requests it does it on.

Run with the pipx venv python:
  ~/.local/share/pipx/venvs/bluetti-bt-lib-sidieje/bin/python tools/link_health_probe.py \
      -m <MAC> -t AC300 -n 20
Add --enc for the encrypted stations (Elite V2 models, AP300, EL10, Charger 2).

Two modes:

  default      run full poll cycles, exactly as Home Assistant does, and report
               for every cycle that was cut short which request was the last
               one sent, how many answered before it, how slow the slowest
               answer of the cycle was, and what the station sent about the
               request it left unanswered.

  --blocks     ask for each poll block on its own, --per-block times each. A
               block that answers fine alone but fails in the middle of a cycle
               is a queueing or timing problem; a block that fails in both is
               the register itself.

The failure kinds the reader now reports:

  silent     the station sent nothing at all about that request
  partial    it started answering and the rest of the frame never arrived
  mismatch   a full frame arrived that answers a different request
