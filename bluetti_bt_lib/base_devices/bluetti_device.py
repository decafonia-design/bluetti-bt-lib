# Asking for one field at a time costs a radio round trip each, and a station
# with 28 of them spends most of a poll cycle waiting for answers. Fields that
# sit near each other are read as one block instead: the answer carries the
# whole range and parse() picks the fields out by offset.
#
# The block limit is the 10 register chunk that the full range scan
# (bluetti_readall) already sends, which is a request size stations are known
# to answer. The gap limit says how many unread registers it is worth carrying
# along to save a round trip. Battery pack fields are not merged; see
# BluettiDevice.__init__.

# Other fields describe the station rather than what it is doing: its identity,
# its firmware, and the Wi-Fi name it was last told to use. Those only change
# when someone intervenes, so asking for them every cycle is traffic that
# answers a question nobody asked. The reader asks for each one once per
# connection and reports the cached value afterwards; see DeviceReader.
#
# Keyed by field name, like the field categories below, so every device that
# declares one of these gets the saving for free. DeviceField.name holds the
# string, not the enum member.
#
# Write verification is not affected: the writer reads back the field it wrote
# through an explicit register list, so a field that is not polled is still
# checked after a write. Battery pack firmware (PACK_VER_*) is deliberately
# absent: those registers sit in the pack bank, which is walked separately, and
# a pack can be swapped while the station stays connected.
